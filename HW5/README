HW 5 Making a Glass Snowglobe
Codepen Link: https://codepen.io/UnciaCoding/pen/MYYbxvQ
Homework that focused on the application of reflection, refraction, and dynamic model, texture, and lighting settings to create more advanced scenes in THREE.js
HW 5 Required me to Create a glass snowglobe, with the following requirements:
  - Glass sphere that has refraction and reflectivity properties
  - Base that supports the sphere and has a texture applied to it
  - Walls and Planes:
    - At least one Wall behind the snow globe
    - A plane that serves as the ground under the globe
    - Wall and floor should have materials/textures that add to the scene 
    - Both should display shadows from the globe
  - Create a scene inside the snow globe
    - At least Two distinct models
    - Import textures and materials as needed
    - Shading
  - Navigation + keyboard controls
    - Implement orbit controls
    - Keyboard controls with arrow keys that:
      - Rotate the scene left and right
      - Tilt the scene up and down
      - '=' to zoom in, '-' to zoom out
  - OPTIONAL (Bonus): Advanced Visuals
    - Add dynamic elements such as falling snow
    - Implement advanced Lighting effects (like sunset or dynamic color changes)
    - Create simple UI like buttons or text to enhance user interaction
