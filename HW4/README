Homework 4 Files, Models, and textures
CodePen Link: https://codepen.io/UnciaCoding/pen/raNoNXr
A homework that explored the 3D modeling capabilities of THREE.js in javascript
The Homework assignment required me to:
  - Make a room with 3 walls, a floor, and a ceiling. Each wall, ceiling, and floor either needed a specific color or texture
  - use THREE.shape to create custom geometry for at least one item in the room. For this part of the assignment, 
    I chose to create a series of rectangles with rounded corners as well as rectangular pegs in order to create the shape
    of a couch. I intend to return to this program at a later date with further knowledge to attempt to create unique functions
    to make the creation of the shaped easier and more efficient. Code is rather long
  - Import at least one texture (done through the couch and the floor) and at least one model
  - Have at least two light sources within the room, set to specific locations, and implement UI to toggle the lights on and off
  - Ensure the relevant objects receive and cast shadows
  - Implement orbital controls so the viewer can move, zoom, and rotate the camera
I attempted to create a cozy candle lit living room that I would like to read in, were I a low-poly model in a video game.
