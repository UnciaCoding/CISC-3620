Codepen Link: https://codepen.io/UnciaCoding/pen/LEEOqww
Final homework assignment of the class in which the expectation is for students to utilize all the concepts learned throughout the course. The assignment is cummulative. 
Students are given free reign to create a scene of their choosing on their own or in a group. Said scene must either be interactive, or be animated.
Scene must utilize as many as possible, but at least 5 of the graphics concepts below (and one must be either interaction or animation):
  - Hierarchical Modeling
  - Lighting and shading
  - Cameras and Projections
  - Materials and Texture-mapping
  - Importing external Models
  - particle systems/effects
  - user interaction
  - animation (using delta time)
  - Physics (using Cannon.js)
  - Custom shaders
If animation is done, it must have at least 2 independently moving objects
